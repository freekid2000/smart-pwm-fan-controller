# Smart PWM Fan Controller

This is the code and designs for an ESP32/ESPHome-based PWM fan controller.

Featuring 8 fan channels, this device can read tachometer speeds of all fans, as well as control overall power and speed via PWM for all 8 fans together.

There are two PCB versions: one featuring a standard DC barrel jack, and one featuring a 90-degree 4-pin Molex EPS connector (traditional CPU power connector).
